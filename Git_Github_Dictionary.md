IMPORTANT: don't do double git init
IMPORTANT: don't remove the .git folder whee your history is kept

4 conceptual areas:
1. Develop. Area : the working directory
2. Staging Area : it's a temporary space to store file before commiting (access via git add)
4. Local repository: the .git folder # where snapshots are saved in your timeline

# Commands
git init: initializes my git repo
git commit -m "meaning message"  # it sends "saves" to the local repository
